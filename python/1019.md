# 1019:Python Conditions and If statements
- [online code sample](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_conditions.asp)
  - FIRST TALK:logical conditions
  - Python supports the usual logical conditions from mathematics:
    - Equals: a == b
    - Not Equals: a != b
    - Less than: a < b
    - Less than or equal to: a <= b
    - Greater than: a > b
    - Greater than or equal to: a >= b
  - These conditions can be used in several ways, most commonly in "if statements" and loops.
  
  - An "if statement" is written by using the if keyword.
