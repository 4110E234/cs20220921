# 1012:Python Data Type:
   - [Python Lists](https://youtu.be/3e-mggtl2IA)
   - [Basic List Operations](https://youtu.be/356a48ncGBU)
# Access List Items
   - [Access List Items](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_lists_access.asp)
   - List items are indexed and you can access them by referring to the index number:
``` python
thislist = ["red", "orange", "yellow"]
print(thislist[1])
```
- [Negative Indexing](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_lists_access.asp)
- Negative indexing means start from the end
- -1 refers to the last item, -2 refers to the second last item etc.
     
``` python
thislist = ["red", "orange", "yellow"]
print(thislist[-1])
```
- [Range of Indexes](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_lists_access.asp)
- You can specify a range of indexes by specifying where to start and where to end the range.
- When specifying a range, the return value will be a new list with the specified items.
- Return the third, fourth, and fifth item:

``` python
thislist = ["red", "orange", "yellow", "green", "blue", "indigo", "violet"]
print(thislist[2:5])

#This will return the items from position 2 to 5.

#Remember that the first item is position 0,
#and note that the item in position 5 is NOT included
```
- Note: The search will start at index 2 (included) and end at index 5 (not included).
- Remember that the first item has index 0.
- By leaving out the start value, the range will start at the first item:
- This example returns the items from the beginning to, but NOT including, "blue":

``` python
thislist = ["red", "orange", "yellow", "green", "blue", "indigo", "violet"]
print(thislist[:4])

#This will return the items from index 0 to index 4.

#Remember that index 0 is the first item, and index 4 is the fifth item
#Remember that the item in index 4 is NOT included
```
- By leaving out the end value, the range will go on to the end of the list:
- This example returns the items from "yellow" to the end:

``` python
thislist = ["red", "orange", "yellow", "green", "blue", "indigo", "violet"]
print(thislist[2:])

#This will return the items from index 2 to the end.

#Remember that index 0 is the first item, and index 2 is the third
