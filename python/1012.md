# 1012:Python Data Type:
   - [Python Lists](https://youtu.be/3e-mggtl2IA)
   - [Basic List Operations](https://youtu.be/356a48ncGBU)
# Python - Access List Items
   - [Access List Items](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_lists_access.asp)
   - List items are indexed and you can access them by referring to the index number:
   
   - Note: The first item has index 0.
``` python
* Print the second item of the list:


thislist = ["red", "orange", "yellow"]
print(thislist[1])
```
- [Negative Indexing](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_lists_access.asp)
- Negative indexing means start from the end
- -1 refers to the last item, -2 refers to the second last item etc.
     
``` python
* Print the last item of the list:


thislist = ["red", "orange", "yellow"]
print(thislist[-1])
```
- [Range of Indexes](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_lists_access.asp)
- You can specify a range of indexes by specifying where to start and where to end the range.
- When specifying a range, the return value will be a new list with the specified items.

- Note: The search will start at index 2 (included) and end at index 5 (not included).
- Remember that the first item has index 0.

``` python
* Return the third, fourth, and fifth item:


thislist = ["red", "orange", "yellow", "green", "blue", "indigo", "violet"]
print(thislist[2:5])

#This will return the items from position 2 to 5.

#Remember that the first item is position 0,
#and note that the item in position 5 is NOT included
```
- By leaving out the start value, the range will start at the first item:

``` python
* This example returns the items from the beginning to, but NOT including, "blue":


thislist = ["red", "orange", "yellow", "green", "blue", "indigo", "violet"]
print(thislist[:4])

#This will return the items from index 0 to index 4.

#Remember that index 0 is the first item, and index 4 is the fifth item
#Remember that the item in index 4 is NOT included
```
- By leaving out the end value, the range will go on to the end of the list:

``` python
* This example returns the items from "yellow" to the end:


thislist = ["red", "orange", "yellow", "green", "blue", "indigo", "violet"]
print(thislist[2:])

#This will return the items from index 2 to the end.

#Remember that index 0 is the first item, and index 2 is the third
```
- [Range of Negative Indexes](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_lists_access.asp)
- Specify negative indexes if you want to start the search from the end of the list:

``` python
* This example returns the items from "orange" (-4) to, but NOT including "violet" (-1):


thislist = ["red", "orange", "yellow", "green", "blue", "indigo", "violet"]
print(thislist[-4:-1])

#Negative indexing means starting from the end of the list.

#This example returns the items from index -4 (included) to index -1 (excluded)

#Remember that the last item has the index -1,
```
- [Check if Item Exists](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_lists_access.asp)
- To determine if a specified item is present in a list use the in keyword:

``` python
* Check if "apple" is present in the list:


thislist = ["red", "orange", "yellow"]
if "red" in thislist:
  print("Yes, 'red' is in the fruits list")
```
# Python - Change List Items
- [Change Item Value](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_lists_change.asp)
- To change the value of a specific item, refer to the index number:

``` python
* Change the second item:


thislist = ["red", "orange", "yellow"]
thislist[1] = "indigo"

print(thislist)
```
- [Change a Range of Item Values](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_lists_change.asp)
- To change the value of items within a specific range, define a list with the new values, and refer to the range of index numbers where you want to insert the new values:

``` python
* Change the values "orange" and "yellow" with the values "indigo" and "violet":


thislist = ["red", "orange", "yellow", "green", "blue", "indigo", "violet"]

thislist[1:3] = ["indigo", "violet"]

print(thislist)
```
- If you insert more items than you replace, the new items will be inserted where you specified, and the remaining items will move accordingly:

``` python
* Change the second value by replacing it with two new values:


thislist = ["red", "orange", "yellow"]

thislist[1:2] = ["indigo", "violet"]

print(thislist)
```
Note: The length of the list will change when the number of items inserted does not match the number of items replaced.
- if you insert less items than you replace, the new items will be inserted where you specified, and the remaining items will move accordingly:

``` python
* Change the second and third value by replacing it with one value:


thislist = ["red", "orange", "yellow"]

thislist[1:3] = ["violet"]

print(thislist)
```
- [Insert Items](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_lists_change.asp)
- To insert a new list item, without replacing any of the existing values, we can use the insert() method.
- The insert() method inserts an item at the specified index:

``` python
* Insert "watermelon" as the third item:


thislist = ["red", "orange", "yellow"]

thislist.insert(2, "indigo")

print(thislist) 
```
Note: As a result of the example above, the list will now contain 4 items.

# Python - Add List Items
- [Append Items](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_lists_add.asp)
- To add an item to the end of the list, use the append() method:

``` python
* Using the append() method to append an item:


thislist = ["red", "orange", "yellow"]

thislist.append("green")

print(thislist)
```
- Insert Items
- To insert a list item at a specified index, use the insert() method.
- The insert() method inserts an item at the specified index:
- Note: As a result of the examples above, the lists will now contain 4 items.

``` python
* Insert an item as the second position:

thislist = ["red", "orange", "yellow"]
thislist.insert(1, "green")
print(thislist)
```
- [Extend List](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_lists_add.asp)
- To append elements from another list to the current list, use the extend() method.

``` python
* Add the elements of colors to thislist:


thislist = ["red", "orange", "yellow"]
colors = ["green", "blue", "indigo"]
thislist.extend(colors)
print(thislist)


(The elements will be added to the end of the list)
```
- [Add Any Iterable](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_lists_add.asp)
- The extend() method does not have to append lists, you can add any iterable object (tuples, sets, dictionaries etc.).

``` python
* Add elements of a color to a list:


thislist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
thiscolor = ("kiwi", "orange")
thislist.extend(thiscolor)
print(thislist)
```
# Python - Remove List Items
- [Remove Specified Item](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_lists_remove.asp)

``` python
* Remove "orange":


thislist = ["red", "orange", "yellow"]
thislist.remove("orange")
print(thislist)
```
- [Remove Specified Index](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_lists_remove.asp)
- The pop() method removes the specified index.

``` python
* Remove the second item:
thislist = ["red", "orange", "yellow"]
thislist.pop(1)
print(thislist)
``` 
- If you do not specify the index, the pop() method removes the last item.
``` 
``` python
* Remove the last item:
thislist = ["Red", "orange", "yellow"]
thislist.pop()
print(thislist)
``` 
- The del keyword also removes the specified index:
``` 
``` python
* Remove the first item:

thislist = ["red", "orange", "yellow"]
del thislist[0]
print(thislist)
``` 
- The del keyword can also delete the list completely.
``` 
``` python
Delete the entire list:


thislist = ["red", "orange", "yellow"]
del thislist
``` 
- [Clear the List](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_lists_remove.asp)
- The clear() method empties the list.
- The list still remains, but it has no content.

``` python
Clear the list content:


thislist = ["red", "orange", "yellow"]
thislist.clear()
print(thislist)
```
