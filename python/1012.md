# 1012:Python Data Type:
   - [Python Lists](https://youtu.be/3e-mggtl2IA)
   - [Basic List Operations](https://youtu.be/356a48ncGBU)
# Python - Access List Items
   - [Access List Items](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_lists_access.asp)
   - List items are indexed and you can access them by referring to the index number:
``` python
thislist = ["red", "orange", "yellow"]
print(thislist[1])
```
- [Negative Indexing](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_lists_access.asp)
- Negative indexing means start from the end
- -1 refers to the last item, -2 refers to the second last item etc.
     
``` python
thislist = ["red", "orange", "yellow"]
print(thislist[-1])
```
- [Range of Indexes](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_lists_access.asp)
- You can specify a range of indexes by specifying where to start and where to end the range.
- When specifying a range, the return value will be a new list with the specified items.
- Return the third, fourth, and fifth item:

``` python
thislist = ["red", "orange", "yellow", "green", "blue", "indigo", "violet"]
print(thislist[2:5])

#This will return the items from position 2 to 5.

#Remember that the first item is position 0,
#and note that the item in position 5 is NOT included
```
- Note: The search will start at index 2 (included) and end at index 5 (not included).
- Remember that the first item has index 0.
- By leaving out the start value, the range will start at the first item:
- This example returns the items from the beginning to, but NOT including, "blue":

``` python
thislist = ["red", "orange", "yellow", "green", "blue", "indigo", "violet"]
print(thislist[:4])

#This will return the items from index 0 to index 4.

#Remember that index 0 is the first item, and index 4 is the fifth item
#Remember that the item in index 4 is NOT included
```
- By leaving out the end value, the range will go on to the end of the list:
- This example returns the items from "yellow" to the end:

``` python
thislist = ["red", "orange", "yellow", "green", "blue", "indigo", "violet"]
print(thislist[2:])

#This will return the items from index 2 to the end.

#Remember that index 0 is the first item, and index 2 is the third
```
- [Range of Negative Indexes](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_lists_access.asp)
- Specify negative indexes if you want to start the search from the end of the list:
- This example returns the items from "orange" (-4) to, but NOT including "violet" (-1):

``` python
thislist = ["red", "orange", "yellow", "green", "blue", "indigo", "violet"]
print(thislist[-4:-1])

#Negative indexing means starting from the end of the list.

#This example returns the items from index -4 (included) to index -1 (excluded)

#Remember that the last item has the index -1,
```
- [Check if Item Exists](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_lists_access.asp)
- To determine if a specified item is present in a list use the in keyword:
- Check if "apple" is present in the list:

``` python
thislist = ["red", "orange", "yellow"]
if "red" in thislist:
  print("Yes, 'red' is in the fruits list")
```
# Python - Change List Items
- [Change Item Value](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_lists_change.asp)
- To change the value of a specific item, refer to the index number:
- Change the second item:

``` python
thislist = ["red", "orange", "yellow"]
thislist[1] = "indigo"

print(thislist)
```
- Change a Range of Item Values
- To change the value of items within a specific range, define a list with the new values, and refer to the range of index numbers where you want to insert the new values:
- Change the values "orange" and "yellow" with the values "indigo" and "violet":

``` python
thislist = ["red", "orange", "yellow", "green", "blue", "indigo", "violet"]

thislist[1:3] = ["indigo", "violet"]

print(thislist)
```
- If you insert more items than you replace, the new items will be inserted where you specified, and the remaining items will move accordingly:
- Change the second value by replacing it with two new values:

``` python
thislist = ["red", "orange", "yellow"]

thislist[1:2] = ["indigo", "violet"]

print(thislist)
```
Note: The length of the list will change when the number of items inserted does not match the number of items replaced.
- if you insert less items than you replace, the new items will be inserted where you specified, and the remaining items will move accordingly:
- Change the second and third value by replacing it with one value:

``` python
thislist = ["red", "orange", "yellow"]

thislist[1:3] = ["violet"]

print(thislist)
```
- Insert Items
- To insert a new list item, without replacing any of the existing values, we can use the insert() method.
- The insert() method inserts an item at the specified index:
- Insert "watermelon" as the third item:

``` python
thislist = ["red", "orange", "yellow"]

thislist.insert(2, "indigo")

print(thislist) 
```
Note: As a result of the example above, the list will now contain 4 items.

# Python - Add List Items
- [Append Items](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_lists_add.asp)
- To add an item to the end of the list, use the append() method:

``` python
Using the append() method to append an item:

thislist = ["red", "orange", "yellow"]

thislist.append("green")

print(thislist)
