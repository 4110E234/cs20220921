# [Python Strings](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_strings.asp)

- strings in Python are arrays of bytes representing `unicode` characters.
``` python
a = "Hello, Joaquin"
print(a[7])

# strings == > array
# index begins with 0
```
- Strings are Arrays ==> acces the elemet of arrays
- Python does not have a character data type, a single character is simply a string with a length of 1

``` python
a = "Hello, Joaquin!"
print(a[4])

# strings == > array
# index begins with 0
```
- Looping Through a String

``` python
for x in "Joaquin":
  print(x)
  ```
- String Length:To get the length of a string, use the `len()`function.
``` python
a = "Hello, Joaquin!"
print(len(a))
# wrong: print(length(a))
```

QUIZ:tell me how many char appear in "qwert yuiop wasd"

``` python
a = "qwert yuiop wasd"
print(len(a))
# wrong: print(length(a))
# 16 = 14 letter 2 space
```
- Check String:To check if a certain phrase or character is present in a string, we can use the keyword `in`.
- keyword `in` vs `if`
- True or False
``` python
txt = "The best things in life are free!QWERTY "
# print("free" in txt) == > True
# print("QWERTY" in txt) == > True
print("QWERTY" in txt)  # False
``

``` python
txt = "The best things in life are free!qwert yuiop wasd"
if "QWERTY" in txt:
  print("Yes, 'QWERTY' is present.")
  ```

``` python
txt = "The best things in life are free!qwert yuiop wasd"
if "QWERTY" in txt:
  print("Yes, 'QWERTY' is present.")
  ```
